        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Adwika is a 12 year old girl.

             My hobbies include listening to music and reading books. My favorite books are Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. My favorite genre of books is Fantasy. My favorite genre of music is K-POP and POP. Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time. ... Not sure how many readers will agree but I firmly believe books can go more in-depth than a movie can.Music has the ability to make you feel every kind of emotion. The reason people never get tired of listening to music is because you can listen for days without listening to the same song. There is so much music out there, and every person on planet Earth has a slightly different style of it. Every day, I found new songs and music never makes me so bored. I have headphones on 24/7.</p>
